# Converter
Python script for generating binary file of nucleon-nucleon interaction matrix elements in c.m. frame, used in Miyagi NuHamil code.

"convert_dat_to_binary.py":
convert .dat file to binary file.

"convert_binary_to_dat.py":
convert binary file to .dat file.

As an example, chiral N3LO interaction of cut-off 500 MeV can be checked by ablve codes.
You can see structure of files in "N3LO_EMN500_kmax8_N100_Jmax8.dat".
